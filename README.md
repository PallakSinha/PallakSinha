### 🌟 About Me
As an **aspiring Data Scientist**, I have a strong foundation in **data visualization, statistical modeling, and business analytics**.  
I’m currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence**, which builds upon my **Data Science and Machine Learning Certification from IIT Delhi**, providing me with hands-on experience in **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel** for end-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling.

I bring a unique blend of **educational experience and analytical thinking**, having previously worked as a **Mathematics teacher**, where I applied data-driven methodologies to improve learning outcomes.  

During my internship at **Elevate Labs**, I:
- Utilized **Python** and **Power BI** to process, analyze, and visualize business data.
- Completed a **capstone project in HR analytics**, developing a **predictive model for employee attrition** and identifying key attrition drivers using classification models.
- Built **interactive dashboards** to communicate insights to HR leadership.
- Ensured **data quality** by cleaning and validating datasets using **pandas**.

I’m now eager to apply these skills in a **fast-paced, data-driven environment**, leveraging my analytical mindset and communication skills to solve real-world business problems.
