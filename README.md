Aspiring Data Scientist | Ex-Mathematics Teacher   
As an aspiring data scientist, I have a strong foundation in data visualization, statistical modeling, and business analytics. I'm eager to apply my analytical mindset and communication skills to a fast-paced, data-driven environment. My certification in Data Science and Machine Learning from IIT Delhi has provided me with hands-on experience in data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel.   
I have experience as a former educator and am skilled at applying data-driven methodologies to improve outcomes. During my internship at Elevate Labs, I utilized Python and Power BI to process, analyze, and visualize data across multiple business functions. I completed a capstone project on HR analytics where I developed a predictive model to forecast employee attrition likelihood and identified key attrition drivers using classification models. I also created interactive dashboards in Power BI to communicate insights to stakeholders and HR leadership. My skills also include data quality assurance by cleaning and validating datasets with pandas.
