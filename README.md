### 🌟 About Me
As an **aspiring Data Scientist**, I have a strong foundation in **data visualization, statistical modeling, and business analytics**.  
I’m currently pursuing my **E-Master’s in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from BITS Pilani**, building upon my **Data Science and Machine Learning Certification from IIT Delhi**, which has provided me with hands-on experience in **Python, SQL, Power BI, and Excel** for end-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling.

I bring a unique blend of **educational experience and analytical thinking**, having previously worked as a **Mathematics teacher**, where I applied data-driven methodologies to improve learning outcomes. I have also completed a **Data Analysis internship at Elevate Labs**, where I strengthened my ability to apply analytical techniques in real-world business contexts.

Across my academic and professional experiences, I have:
- Applied **Python-based data analysis** workflows to clean, transform, and analyze structured datasets.
- Developed **predictive and classification models** to identify patterns, trends, and key drivers in business and HR-related data.
- Designed and delivered **interactive dashboards** using **Power BI** to communicate insights effectively to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Ensured **data quality and reliability** through systematic data cleaning, validation, and exploratory analysis using **pandas**.
- Translated analytical findings into **actionable insights** to support data-driven decision-making.

I’m now eager to apply these skills in a **fast-paced, data-driven environment**, leveraging my analytical mindset and strong communication abilities to solve real-world business problems.
